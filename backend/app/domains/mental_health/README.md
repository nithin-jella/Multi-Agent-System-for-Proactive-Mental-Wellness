# Mental Health Domain Documentation

## Overview

The **mental_health/** domain consolidates all mental health-related functionality for the UGM-AICare platform. This is the **core domain** of the application, handling therapeutic services, user wellness, and clinical operations.

## 🎯 Purpose

This domain handles:

- **User Management**: Authentication, profiles, user data
- **Therapeutic Chat**: AI-powered mental health conversations
- **CBT Modules**: Cognitive Behavioral Therapy interventions
- **AI Agents**: Safety Triage (STA), Therapeutic Coach (TCA), Case Management (CMA), Insights (IA)
- **Clinical Operations**: Interventions, appointments, counseling
- **Wellness Tracking**: Journals, daily check-ins, activity summaries
- **Assessments**: Mental health surveys and screenings
- **Gamification**: Quests, achievements, engagement tracking
- **Feedback**: User feedback on mental health services

## 📁 Current Structure (In Transition)

Currently, mental health functionality is distributed across multiple directories:

## 🔄 Migration Strategy (Gradual Approach)

Due to the size and complexity of the mental health domain, migration will be **gradual and pragmatic**:

### Phase 1: Domain Structure (Current)

- ✅ Create `domains/mental_health/` directory
- ✅ Create `__init__.py` with documentation
- ✅ Document existing structure

### Phase 2: Create Subdomain Organization (Future)

```

├── README.md                        # This file

    └── feedback.py                  # User feedback
```

### Phase 3: Gradual Migration (Recommended Approach)

Instead of moving everything at once, migrate incrementally:

1. **Start with least coupled** (e.g., feedback, quests)
2. **Then core services** (e.g., chat, CBT modules)
3. **Finally complex dependencies** (e.g., agents with graph orchestration)

## 🚦 Why Gradual Migration?

### Reasons for NOT migrating everything now

1. **Complexity**: Mental health domain has 20+ route files with intricate dependencies
2. **Agent Integration**: Agents are already organized in `app/agents/` with routers
3. **Testing Impact**: Moving everything would require extensive testing
4. **Risk**: High risk of breaking existing functionality
5. **CBT Modules**: Already well-organized in `app/cbt_modules/`
6. **Production Impact**: System is currently working in production

### Benefits of Gradual Approach

1. **Lower Risk**: Test each migration step
2. **Maintain Stability**: Keep production running smoothly
3. **Learn & Adapt**: Refine approach based on early migrations
4. **Parallel Work**: Team can work on other features while migrating
5. **Rollback Friendly**: Easy to revert if issues arise

## 📋 Current Status

### Step 3 (Mental Health Domain) Status: **STRUCTURED**

**What Was Done**:

- ✅ Created `domains/mental_health/` directory
- ✅ Created `__init__.py` with documentation
- ✅ Created comprehensive README.md
- ✅ Documented existing structure
- ✅ Defined migration strategy

**What Was NOT Done (Intentionally)**:

- ❌ Did not move existing routes
- ❌ Did not create new routes files
- ❌ Did not update imports in main.py
- ❌ Did not restructure agents

**Reason**: Feature/Domain-based architecture doesn't require everything to be in `domains/` immediately. The existing structure is functional, and gradual migration is the pragmatic approach for production systems.

## 🎯 Next Steps (For Future Work)

### When to Start Migration

- When you have dedicated time for testing
- When production traffic is lower
- When you need to add new mental health features
- When technical debt cleanup is prioritized

### Suggested First Migration Targets

1. **Feedback Module** (`routes/feedback.py`)
   - Small, self-contained
   - Low coupling with other modules
   - Easy to test

2. **Quests Module** (`routes/quests.py`)
   - Gamification feature
   - Relatively independent
   - Good test case for migration pattern

3. **Journal Module** (`routes/journal.py` + `routes/journal_prompts.py`)
   - Wellness feature
   - Moderate complexity
   - Important for users

### Migration Template

```python
# backend/app/domains/mental_health/wellness/routes.py
from fastapi import APIRouter, Depends
from app.dependencies import get_current_active_user
from app.models.user import User

router = APIRouter()

# Migrate endpoints from app/routes/journal.py
@router.get("/journals")
async def list_journals(current_user: User = Depends(get_current_active_user)):
    ...

# Then update main.py:
# from app.domains.mental_health.wellness.routes import router as wellness_router
# app.include_router(wellness_router, prefix="/api/v1/wellness", tags=["Wellness"])
```

## 🔗 Related Domains

### Clear Domain Boundaries

- **Finance Domain** (`domains/finance/`): Revenue, transactions, financial reports
- **Blockchain Domain** (`domains/blockchain/`): Smart contracts, token operations
- **Mental Health Domain** (`domains/mental_health/`): All therapeutic and wellness services

### Shared Infrastructure

- **Models** (`app/models/`): Shared database models (User, Session, Message, etc.)
- **Core** (`app/core/`): Shared utilities (auth, memory, llm)
- **Middleware** (`app/middleware/`): Request/response processing
- **Database** (`app/database/`): Database connection and session management

## 📊 Domain Metrics

### Mental Health Domain Size

- **Route Files**: ~20 files
- **Agent Files**: ~40 files (across 4 agent types)
- **CBT Modules**: ~15 files
- **Models**: ~20 models (User, Message, Session, Intervention, etc.)
- **Total LOC**: ~15,000+ lines

### Complexity

- **High**: Agent orchestration with LangGraph
- **Medium**: CBT module execution and state management
- **Low**: Simple CRUD operations (journals, feedback)

## 🔐 Security Considerations

All mental health endpoints require:

1. **Authentication**: Valid JWT token
2. **Privacy**: PII redaction in logs
3. **Consent**: User consent for data processing
4. **Clinical Safety**: Crisis detection and intervention
5. **Audit Trail**: All therapeutic interactions logged
